# This is the self-verification step every autonomous loop must pass before it
# claims a task is done (see docs/loops/). It mirrors the CI "quality" + "build"
# jobs so a loop can catch its own regressions locally, in seconds, without a
# database.
#
#   PASS  -> exit 0, the working tree is safe to commit / open a PR from.
#   FAIL  -> exit non-zero, the loop must fix the reported step before retrying.
#
# Tiers:
#   (default)  prisma generate + lint + typecheck + unit tests + production build
#   --full     also runs integration + E2E (needs the test Postgres on :5434)
#
# The integration/E2E tiers need Docker + a database, so the default gate stays
# fast and hermetic; CI runs the full pyramid on every PR.
