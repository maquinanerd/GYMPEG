# Loops: how GymCoach maintains itself

This repo is partly maintained by **autonomous loops** running on Claude Code: small
programs that prompt the agent, read what it produced, verify it, and decide whether
to keep going. You stop prompting the agent and start authoring the loop.

This folder is the reproducible playbook. Read in order:

- [`00-concept.md`](00-concept.md) - what a loop actually is, the five-stage lineage,
  and the six ingredients mapped to real Claude Code tools.
- [`01-foundations.md`](01-foundations.md) - the four things a loop needs first:
  `CLAUDE.md`, the green-gate (`scripts/verify.sh`), permissions
  (`.claude/settings.json`), and a reusable skill.
- [`02-issue-to-pr-loop.md`](02-issue-to-pr-loop.md) - the flagship loop that turns
  open issues into pull requests, its guardrails, and how it graduates to the cloud.
- [`03-triage-loop.md`](03-triage-loop.md) - the head of the pipeline: manufacture
  well-scoped issues so the Issue -> PR loop never starves.
- [`04-ship-loop.md`](04-ship-loop.md) - the shipping half: watch CI, fix a red gate,
  self-review, and auto-merge on green. Where the full gate actually gates a merge.
- [`05-content-loop.md`](05-content-loop.md) - the tail: keep the CHANGELOG and this
  playbook true to what shipped. The growth engine.
- [`06-orchestration.md`](06-orchestration.md) - the maintainer loop that runs all the
  stages end to end, and how it graduates to a nightly cron.
- [`07-autonomy.md`](07-autonomy.md) - the charter for running unsupervised: mandate,
  hard guardrails, the stop-for-human list, the subagent challenge protocol, and the
  rollback baseline. Paired with the append-only [`autonomy-log.md`](autonomy-log.md).
- [`08-ideation-loop.md`](08-ideation-loop.md) - the head above triage: when even triage
  comes up dry, manufacture bounded **product** feature ideas (the cheap, recurring cousin
  of the one-off deep-research workflow) so the product keeps growing, not just the test
  suite. Logs to [`ideas-backlog.md`](ideas-backlog.md).
- [`09-memory-and-learning.md`](09-memory-and-learning.md) - the loop as a control system:
  how it manages/compresses context (state in git, not the session), learns (layered
  filesystem memory + lessons that **graduate** into skills - no vector RAG), and regrounds
  on its purpose. Staging area in [`lessons.md`](lessons.md); the per-batch human reading
  list (comprehension-debt antidote) in [`review-digest.md`](review-digest.md).
- [`10-external-contributions.md`](10-external-contributions.md) - the trust and vetting
  policy for external issues and PRs: trust tiers, the execution gate (CI is the only
  executor of unvetted code), the hard-block path list, the three vetting passes, the
  issue-adoption pipeline, and the human-granted vetted-contributor ladder.

## The system at a glance

```
            maintainer loop (06): cron + a decision-maker each tick
                                  |
   +-------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+
   v             v             v                       v             v
 triage (03)  ideate (08)  implement (02)        ship-pr (04)   write-up (05)
 refill code  refill        one issue -> one PR   watch CI, fix  CHANGELOG +
 -health when PRODUCT       (branch->code->test)  red, review,   playbook stay
 backlog low  ideas when                          auto-merge     true to reality
   |          starved (bounded)  |                 GREEN  |          |
   +-------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+
                                  |
                    scripts/verify.sh + CI = the feedback gate
                    (nothing merges on a red or pending gate)
                                  |
                    state lives in git + GitHub, not the session
```

The pipeline is **generate work -> do work -> verify in CI -> ship -> tell the story**.
Each stage is a small loop calling one tested skill; `06` is the loop that runs them.
`triage` (03) generates code-health work; `ideate` (08) generates product work when even
triage is dry, so the product grows toward "the most complete AI fitness app", not just a
tidier repo.

## The four rules we never break

1. A loop is only as good as its feedback - everything self-verifies before claiming
   success.
2. The reusable unit is a skill, not a prompt.
3. The loop must halt - max iterations, no-progress detection, budget ceiling.
4. Durability is explicit - state lives in git and on GitHub, not only in a session.
