# Stages: deps -> builder -> prod-deps -> runner
# Uses `output: 'standalone'` from next.config.js, completed by a full production
# node_modules (the Prisma 7 client and its migration CLI pull a dependency
# closure that standalone tracing does not capture).
#
# The official Node image comes through the AWS ECR Public mirror of Docker
# Official Images (same image): anonymous pulls from Docker Hub hit its rate
# limit on shared CI runners. Override NODE_IMAGE to use another registry.

# ---- Stage 3: prod-deps (production-only node_modules for the runner) ----
# Prisma 7 dropped the bundled Rust engine: the app talks to Postgres through the
# pg driver adapter at runtime, and `prisma migrate deploy` loads prisma.config.ts
# through @prisma/config, which pulls a deep dependency closure (effect, c12, ...).
# Cherry-picking those out of node_modules is unmaintainable (it is what made the
# bcrypt #127 image bug recur), so the runner gets a real `npm ci --omit=dev`
# tree: app runtime deps + the Prisma CLI + tsx (the demo reseed). bcrypt's
# native binding is built here for the alpine target too.
