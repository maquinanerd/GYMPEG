// target rep range, we increase the load (+2.5 kg compound, +1 kg isolation).
// Otherwise we keep the load and beat the reps.
//
// Auto-regulation (issue #53): a recent readiness/soreness check-in can make
// the suggestion more conservative - it may HOLD the load (skip the increment)
// or apply a single step-down when recovery is very poor. It can NEVER raise the
// load beyond the normal progression rule (safety; avoids gaming the check-in).
// With no readiness data in the recency window the output is identical to the
// rule above.
