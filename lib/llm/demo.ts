const DEBRIEF = `## Weekly recap

Solid week: 3 sessions logged, total working volume up about 4% versus last week.

**Progressing**
- Barbell bench press: 70 kg x 8 at RIR 2 on the top set, estimated 1RM up again.
- Pronated pull-ups: clean reps across all sets, ready for added load.

**Personal records**
- New PR on Barbell bench press: 70 kg x 8 edged your all-time best estimated 1RM. Nice work - that is the strongest this lift has read.

**Goal check**
- Barbell bench press: 92% of the way to your 80 kg x 8 target on the estimated-1RM scale. One more clean progression and it should fall.

**Watch (possible plateau)**
- Cable lateral raises are flagged as stalled: estimated 1RM flat over the last 3 sessions at the same load and reps.

**Fatigue signals**
- RIR is holding around 2 and no deload is recommended this week, so keep pushing.

**Conditioning**
- 95 of your 150 weekly target minutes logged (9.6 km across 2 cardio sessions), up from 60 minutes last week. Aerobic volume is climbing but still moderate, so it is not cutting into lifting recovery yet - keep the easy pace.
- Interference check: your longer run landed the day before your leg session, so the same recovery budget got hit twice - move hard runs away from heavy lower-body days (easy cardio after lifting or on rest days) to protect leg progress.

**Suggestions for next week**
- Push bench to 72.5 kg for the first working sets - that lines up with your stated goal.
- Bias a little more side-delt volume.

**Points of attention**
- Nothing flagged in your session notes.
- Your note to me ("shoulder is bothering me, go easy on pressing") is noted - I have kept overhead and bench pressing conservative this week and biased volume to movements that spare the shoulder. Update or clear the note whenever that changes.

const CHAT_IN_SESSION = `Got it - looking at your live session.

- **Right now**: your logged sets are at or above target reps, so the load is well chosen. Keep it for the remaining sets and stop at RIR 2.
- **Shoulder caution**: if a press feels off, drop the load about 10% for the next set or swap to the next exercise in your plan and come back; never push through joint pain.
- **Rest**: take the full programmed rest before the next set - rushing it costs reps.

Log how the next set feels and ask me again if it does not improve.`;

const CHAT = `Short version: your bench is moving and your chest volume is in a good spot.

- **Bench press**: estimated 1RM is trending up (about +6% over the last 8 weeks) while your RIR stays around 2, so the stimulus is sustainable. Keep adding ~2.5 kg once you hit the top of the rep range on all sets.
- **Chest volume**: you are around 13-15 hard sets per week, solidly in the productive 10-20 range for most lifters (Schoenfeld). No need to add more yet.
- **Next session**: aim for the top of the range on incline dumbbell press, and only add a fly set if recovery feels easy.

Want me to turn this into concrete load targets for your next push day?`;
