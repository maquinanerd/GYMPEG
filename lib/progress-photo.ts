// ============================================================
// Local-only file storage for progress photos, plus the content sniffing the
// upload route relies on. Security posture:
// - The accepted formats are a hard ALLOWLIST (jpeg/png/webp), decided by the
//   file's magic bytes only - the client-declared Content-Type is never
//   trusted, so a disguised extension or spoofed header changes nothing.
// - Files are written non-executable (0o600) under a gitignored uploads dir,
//   which is never exposed as a public static path; every read goes through
//   an ownership-scoped API route.
// - Stored paths are RELATIVE to the storage dir and re-resolved on every
//   access with a containment check, so a corrupted/hostile DB value can
//   never escape the uploads dir.
