// Ratchet for issues #317 and #323: every API route that addresses a resource
// the caller does not own by construction must be referenced by an
// ownership-aware integration test, so such a route cannot ship without a
// cross-user case and an existing one cannot silently lose its coverage.
//
// Two families are covered:
// - PARAMETERIZED routes, matched on any `[param]` path segment rather than
//   the literal `[id]`, so a future `[gymId]`-style segment cannot escape.
// - BODY-ADDRESSED routes, which take someone's resource id in the request
//   body and are invisible to any path-based glob; they are enumerated below
//   because only a human can tell that a payload field is a resource id.
//
// This test needs no database; it only reads the tree.
